For CP1: How to run the chatroom?
We have only one python file "node.py". 
1. Copy it to VM #1~5 or any two VMs within #1~5 (node address hard-coded)
2. Run command "python node.py" on each VM
3. Type message to chat
4. Type "q" to exit chatroom process on each VM
5. We can still chat even some processes exited.

For CP2: How to run the chatroom?
We have only one python file "mp1.py". 
1. Copy it to VM #1~8.
2. Run command "python mp1.py" on each VM
3. Type message to chat. Each node will deliver messages in total ordering
4. Kill any node process to test Heartbeat failure detection.
5. Resume chating on the remaining nodes.

Cheers,

```
