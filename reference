3.Max Delay
TA: T = 200ms ~ 10s; 5~10x RTT

#10 -ping-> #01
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.108/0.131/0.190/0.017 ms

#02 -ping-> #09
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.117/0.176/1.530/0.178 ms

#03 -ping-> #08
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.094/0.151/1.529/0.180 ms

TAï¼šMax Delay= 200-500 ms; T = 2 times Max Delay

4. Timer Thread: 
Each node have 7 timer thread to detect the failure
We found it is slow because each thread check the time very frequently.
How to solve: delay check time
